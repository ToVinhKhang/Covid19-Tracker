		"title": "VACCINE TECHNOLOGY",
		"content": "MRNA - THE POSTMAN<h6>It is the most advanced and widely available technology in the world owned by Pfizer and Moderna. Using only Covid-19's mRNA genetic code like a postman, when injected into the body, this code will tell human cells to produce the virus's own protein, thereby creating antibodies. </h6><h6 class='plusSign'>The great advantages of these vaccines are less side effects, very high rate of immunogenicity (90-95%), but the obstacles are high price (25-30 usd/dose) and difficult storage (Pfizer needs cold at minus 70 degrees Celsius, Moderna needs less cold).</h6>VIRAL VECTOR - THE TRANSPORTER<h6>This is considered the second most widely available vaccine. Three vaccine companies of Johnson & Johnson (J&J - USA), AstraZeneca (Europe) and Sputnik-V (Russia) use this vector technology. They implanted a piece of the Covid-19 gene into a harmless virus (such as the flu virus, or an adenovirus), and then had it transport the gene segment into human cells. The cell will use that gene to produce a specific protein fragment of Covid-19. Once injected, it teaches the immune system how to fight the actual virus. </h6><h6 class='plusSign'>The advantages are good immunogenicity (65%-95%), easy storage (just a common refrigerator) and cheap price (only 3-4 USD/dose). A few deaths have been reported with the AstraZeneca vaccine.</h6>INACTIVATED VIRUS - THE MUMMIES<h6>SinoPharm, CoronaVac (China) and Covaxin (India) vaccines follow classical technology, which means culturing large numbers of Covid-19 viruses and then inactivating them with chemicals that make them unable to reproduce or cause disease. . Once injected, your body gets used to the virus. When live viruses invade, your body immediately recognizes and destroys them. In addition to China, the countries that have used the vaccine include the UAE, Pakistan and Hungary. </h6><h6 class='plusSign'>The outstanding advantage of this inactivated vaccine is that it is cheap and available, but the rate of immunity is low̉ (50%-78% of the injectors develop immunity), that is, only 5-8 people get antibodies after 10 injections.</h6>PROTEIN-BASED - THE PROTECTOR<h6>It is the newest US vaccine currently on the market. Novavax's technology combines both new and old techniques. To make the vaccine, Novavax combines another virus, a baculovirus (moth body cells), and the genetic information needed to make the spike protein. When these cells are infected with SARS-CoV-2, they produce spike proteins. Scientists 'harvest' and connect these spike proteins to nanoparticles to protect the body from the attack of the Covid-19 virus. </h6><h6 class='plusSign'>Although still in the testing process, Nanovax has now been shown to be 91% effective in high-risk populations, and is seen as the only hope for stopping this pandemic. The advantage of this vaccine is that it creates strong immunity and has few side effects. The main problems experienced by volunteers trying the vaccine were fatigue, headaches, and muscle aches that lasted about two days.</h6><h6 class='plusSign reference'>- BBC News -</h6>"
